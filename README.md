Aloha, 'o Sean ko'u inoa akā, 'o @Sean-OofMars ko'u inoa kapakapa! (Hi, I'm Sean, but my tag here is @Sean-OofMars!) I am a 20-something year old working on his future. 
If you stumbled here from a resume or LinkedIn, just know I wrote this in July of 2022.
This is where I plan to store code for experiments in Unity, applications in Salesforce, and solutions across my journey.

A little background about me, I graduated High School in 2019 and got into an experimental college called "42 Silicon Valley" (42SV). It was a fast track to learning code
and hopefully getting a job. Unforunately, March 2020 rolled around and the school closed down. From then on I've been trying to find/forge pathways to get to where
I want to end up, a Gameplay Developer.

I have tried traditional schooling as well as an online resource to try and force my way in, but they weren't as fruitful as I had hoped. As of July 2022, I am working
with Purple Mai'a/Hiapo on becoming a Salesforce Developer. Hopefully with the stability and fallback option of such a powerful and useful company, I can work on personal
projects and quickly shift towards what I really want to do.

If you want to contact me regarding a job, some help, or you just want to chat with a nerd, you can reach me at 808seano@gmail.com. Add "GITHUB" in all caps to your title
so I know where it's from.

Aloha, a hui hou!
